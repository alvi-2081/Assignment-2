OPERATORS IN DART:

There are three types og operators in dart.
1) Arithmetic Operators
2) Equality and Relational Operators
3) Logical Operators

1) ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

var a = 22;
var b = 10;

+Addition, Use to add two operands.
	var c = a + b;
	print(c);
32

â€“Subtraction, Use to subtract two operands.
	var c = a - b;
	print(c);
12

*Multiply, Use to multiply two operands.
	var c = a * b;
	print(c);
220

/Division, Use to divide two operands.
	var c = a / b; 
	print(c);
2.2

~/Division, Use two divide two operands but give output in integer.
	var c = a ~/ b;
	print(c);
2

%Modulus, Use to give remainder of two operands.
	var c = a % b;
	print(c);
2

2) EQUALITY AND RELATIONAL OPERATORS:

> Greater than, Check which operand is bigger and give result as boolean expression.
	a > b;
True
		
< Less than, Check which operand is smaller and give result as boolean expression.
	a < b;
False

>= Greater than or equal to, Check which operand is greater or equal to each other and give result as boolean expression.
	a >= b;
True

<= less than equal to, Check which operand is less than or equal to each other and give result as boolean expression.
	a <= b;
False

== Equal to, Check whether the operand are equal to each other or not and give result as boolean expression.
	a == b;
False

!= Not Equal to, Check whether the operand are not equal to each other or not and give result as boolean expression.
	a != b;
True

3) LOGICAL OPERATORS:

&& And Operator, Use to add two conditions and if both are true than it will return true.
	bool c = a > 10 && b < 10;
	print(c);
False
    

|| Or Operator, Use to add two conditions and if even one of them is true than it will return true.
	bool d = a > 10 || b < 10;
	print(d);
True


! Not Operator, It is use to reverse the result.
	bool e = !(a > 10);
	print(e);
False
