List of All data types in DART:

Numbers – int, double, num
String
Boolean
List
Map

1 . NUMBERS:
a. int : Integer is a type of non fractional number value without. 
    Here non fractional means a value without point. Integer dose not support POINT 
    values. It can only hold pure numeric values. See the example below.

int tempNum = 123456;
print(tempNum);
// Output should be : 123456

b. double : Double are basically bigger type of FLOAT values. It can hold fractional
    decimal values. In dart the double support 64 bit double prescription values. 
    double also represents floating point literals.

 double i = 52.11 ;
 print(i);
 // Output should be 52.11

c. num : Num can be an integer or a decimal value both can be a num.

 num i = 44.11 ;
 print(i);
 // Output should be 44.11

2 . STRING:
    String data type represents a sequence of multiple characters text also known as group
    of multiple characters. In Dart string is sequence of UTF-16 code units. 
    String can be created using both single quotes and double quotes but both should 
    be same a creation time.

String name1 = 'Flutter';
String name2 = "Examples";
print(name1 + ' ' +name2);
// Output should be Flutter Examples

3 . BOOLEAN :
    Boolean data type is used to hold true and false values. Boolean data type uses the 
    ‘bool‘ keyword on declaration time.

bool val1 = true;
bool val2 = false;
print(val1);
print (val2);
// Output should be true & false

4 . LIST : 
    List is a group of multiple data with same data type like a collection box. 
    We could say List is like an Array to hold same type of multiple values. 
    The store in ordered sequence in List and Like array every single ITEM of List 
    can be accessed via its index number.

 List<int> rollNum = List(6);
  rollNum[0] = 1;  
  rollNum[1] = 2;
  rollNum[2] = 3;
  rollNum[3] = 4;
  rollNum[4] = 5;
  rollNum[5] = 6;

  for (int elements in rollNum) {
    print(elements);
  }

// Output should be :
1
2
3
4
5
6

5 . MAP:
    Same as List data type Map data type is also a type of group of multiple values. 
    In Map the data stored in key:value pairs format. There is no bound for key value 
    they can be in any type. Map date can also have null type of values. Map are like 
    objects with multiple values.

var temp = {
    "roll_num": "123",
    "phoneNum": "0987654321",
    "name": "Pankaj",
  };
print(temp);

// Output should be : {roll_num: 123, phoneNum: 0987654321, name: Pankaj}
